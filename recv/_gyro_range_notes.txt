Our output sensor readings should be in the range of a 16bit signed value:
-32768,32767
Empirically, they usually stay within
-32764,32764
Probably because the lower bits may be used for additional info.
These lower bits are largely insignificant (which is why they are oftened used for other purposes in the first place).

This range is mapped onto a range of DPS (degrees per second).
The DPS range is determined by some configuration bits in the 0x11 (config) address.
This range may go as high as +/-2000dps or as low as +/-125dps, depending on the configuration.

The general rule: the smaller the DPS range, the more sensitive the device.
(This seems to make sense, because we get more possible output values for every degree/sec).

Therefore, we should configure our DPS range as small as we can, so long as our output values stay within that range.
Our range will probably be on the smaller side, because the swallowing motion will not be very fast (speculation).
But if the entire body moves, our readings may rise outside of our configured range.

Therefore, we have two options:
1) Increase the configured range to capture all data, at the cost of sensitivity, or
2) Realize that we are capping our output data to the height of a small range,
   which causes us to lose the magnitude of big readings (which is likely a non-issue),
   and allows us to keep the higher sensitivity.
Option 2 is preferred.

Calibration, with respect to output range:
The greater the output range, the "lower" the resting error of the gyro (the reading when at rest, which should be 0).
In reality, while the absolute readings are lower, it doesn't mean that the error is any less in terms of deg/sec.
When we change the output range, we must either
1) recalibrate, which costs more time, or
3) scale our calibration constants inversely with the size of our output range, which may be less accurate.
Option 1 is preferred.
But we should pick one output range and stick with it, and this will not apply.

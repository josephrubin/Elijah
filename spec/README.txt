Spec
Joseph Rubin

The specification should be extremely helpful in understanding how Elijah functions, both the transmission component and the reception component.

>> If you are searching for a compiled PDF version of the spec, simply look in xtra/ <<

If you recompile the spec, you might want to configure your texstudio to put all auxilary files in xtra/
If you are using MikTex,
See here: https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/184204/texstudio-biber-build-folder
(I also had to add -output-directory=xtra/ to PdfLaTeX.)

Visio files are in diagrams/.

The images used in the spec are in ../image/.
If you need to recompile the spec, make sure the images are there!
